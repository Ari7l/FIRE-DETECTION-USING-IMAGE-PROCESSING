# FIRE-DETECTION-USING-IMAGE-PROCESSING
With this project we overcame the limitations of traditional fire detection techniques by making use of already available resources
We used Python's Open CV library to detect the fire as well as humans. We used Harr Cascade Classifier to train our algorithm to successfully classify the
between fire and non-fire images.
